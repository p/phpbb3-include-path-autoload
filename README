Autoloading of dependencies from include_path for phpBB 3.1
===========================================================

This little gem is a class loader that will require files located on
include_path.

It is meant to be used together with e.g.
https://github.com/p/phpbb3-dependencies.

You can make use of it in one of two ways:

1. Arrange for PHPBB_AUTOLOAD environment variable to have an absolute path
to this file. For example for php-fpm you could say:

env[PHPBB_AUTOLOAD] = /home/phpdev/shared/phpbb_autoload.php

2. Copy it as [PHPBB_ROOT]/vendor/.composer/autoload.php

Note: I have not tested this option but in theory it should work.

Then you need to put the dependencies on the include_path.
For example with php-fpm you could do:

php_value[include_path] = .:/home/pie/apps/git-phpbb3-dependencies
